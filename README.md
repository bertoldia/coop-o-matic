Chicken Coop Automation Via node. Currently this is a configuration-file driven
miscellaneous sensor aggregator and camera multiplexer. It can aggregate sensor
sources via either a url or command line application.

In truth this is not limited to chicken-coop automation applications, but that's
what I developed it for.
